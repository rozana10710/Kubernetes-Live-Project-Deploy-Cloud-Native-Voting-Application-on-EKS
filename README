Kubernetes Live Project: Deploy Cloud Native Voting Application on EKS
￼


1. trust policies vs policies
2. add ons: EBS CSI add on
    1. what is the deafult storage behaviour when creating an eks cluster? and what does the EBS add on provide?
    2. what is the IRSA assosiated with the add on and what does it do?
    3. IRSA, STS meaning?
3. WORKER NODES
    1. what do i get by default from creating an eks cluster? —> control plane that does not appear in my account (managed by aws)
    2. worker node IAM policies, what mini policies does it have?
    3. from where does the worker node get permissions to access the API server? —> not the IAM role, rather the aws-auth config map that says: “hey if you got a request from IAM ROLE X, treat it as the Y user on the kubernetes cluster”
4. NODE GROUPS?
    1. what are they?
    2. the permissions they need
5. CONNECTION TO THE CLUSTER?
    1. how does a bastian host (or your host) connects to the cluster?
        * EC2 instance: role that must give access to the cluster “using actions like eks:AccessKubernetesapi”
            * aws-cli + change context to point to your cluster
            * fix “aws-auth” config map to allow aws-cli access from that IAM role  ORRRRR add keys to the machine (NOT recommended) check here:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/auth-configmap.html
        * HOST elsewhere:  keys. as there’s no IAM role (not recommended)
